	<a href="https://doyensec.com">Doyensec</a>'s ImageMagick Security Policy Evaluator allows developers and security experts to check if an XML Security Policy is hardened against a wide set of malicious attacks. It assists with the process of reviewing such policies, which is usually a manual task, and helps identify the best practices for ImageMagick deployments.
